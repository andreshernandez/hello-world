# hello-world
A place to try and write down a few ideas 

Hello world,

I'll be trying a few motion, interaction, and generative design ideas in this space. I'll try prorotypes using processsing, p5.js and a few javascript libraries.

As I make progress I'd also appreciate help, feedback, and guidance from the community.

See you soon,
Andres
